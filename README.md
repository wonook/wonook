### Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Wonook and my research interests reside in distributed systems for efficiently processing big data (batch & stream) and performing large-scale AI (training & serving). My recent focuses are on topics regarding efficient systems on inference serving for generative AI, with support for optimizations like continuous batching, KV caching, quantization, and fine-tuning. My works are presented at top-level computer science conferences and journals including USENIX ATC, ACM EuroSys, and ACM TOCS.  

### I finished my Ph.D. in computer science at <a href="https://en.snu.ac.kr">Seoul National University</a> in 2023, under the supervision of <a href="https://bgchun.github.io">Professor Byung-Gon Chun</a>. My dissertation title is "<a href="https://s-space.snu.ac.kr/bitstream/10371/196490/1/000000177553.pdf">Efficient and Adaptive Resource Management for Dynamically Optimizing Distributed Data Processing Systems</a>". I also received my B.S. degree in computer science from <a href="https://en.snu.ac.kr">Seoul National University</a> in 2017.
### You can check out my list of works on <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OKtsXwMAAAAJ">Google Scholar</a> as well.  

### Apart from work, I do a lot of sports (mainly tennis, golf, and BJJ nowadays), learn new languages, and meet new people. Due to my experience living around the world, I happen to be a motivation-driven, multicultural person with a flexible mind, who is open, adaptive, and a fast learner for new knowledge and people.
